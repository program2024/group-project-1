 Usually we use two keys represented as “a” and “b”, together with modular arithmetic to change each letter. The encryption function  𝐸(𝑥) = (𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏) \ mod m Maps each character to another character in the alphabet, offering a simple yet effective method of encryption. Conversely,  𝐷(𝑦) = 𝑎^{-1} (𝑦 - 𝑏) \mod m
